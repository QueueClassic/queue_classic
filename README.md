## What is queue_classic?

queue_classic provides a simple interface to a PostgreSQL-backed message queue. queue_classic specializes in concurrent locking and minimizing database load while providing a simple, intuitive developer experience. queue_classic assumes that you are already using PostgreSQL in your production environment and that adding another dependency (e.g. redis, beanstalkd, 0mq) is undesirable.

## Features

* Leverage of PostgreSQL's listen/notify & row locking.
* Support for multiple queues with heterogeneous workers.
* JSON data format.
* Forking workers.
* Workers can work multiple queues.
* Reduced row contention using a [relaxed FIFO](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~shanir/nir-pubs-web/Papers/Lock_Free.pdf) technique.

## Usage

There are 2 ways to use queue_classic.

* Producing Jobs
* Working Jobs

### Producing Jobs

The first argument is a string which represents a ruby object and a method name. The second argument(s) will be passed along as arguments to the method invocation defined by the first argument. The set of arguments will be encoded as JSON in the database.

```ruby
# This method has no arguments.
QC.enqueue("Time.now")

# This method has 1 argument.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.puts", "hello world")

# This method has 2 arguments.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.printf", "hello %s", "world")

# This method has a hash argument.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.puts", {"hello" => "world"})

# This method has an array argument.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.puts", ["hello", "world"])

# This method uses a non-default queue.
p_queue = QC::Queue.new("priority_queue")
p_queue.enqueue("Kernel.puts", ["hello", "world"])
```

There is also the possibility to schedule a job at a specified time in the future. It will not be worked off before that specified time.

```ruby
# Specifying the job execution time exactly.
QC.enqueue_at(Time.new(2024,01,02,10,00), "Kernel.puts", "hello future")

# Specifying the job execution time as an offset in seconds.
QC.enqueue_in(60, "Kernel.puts", "hello from 1 minute later")
```

### Working Jobs

There are two ways to work jobs. The first approach is to use the Rake task. The second approach is to use a custom executable.

#### Rake Task

Require queue_classic in your Rakefile.

```ruby
require 'queue_classic'
require 'queue_classic/tasks'
```

Start the worker via the Rakefile.
```bash
$ bundle exec rake qc:work
```

Setup a worker to work a non-default queue.
```bash
$ QUEUE="priority_queue" bundle exec rake qc:work
```

Setup a worker to work multiple queues.
```bash
$ QUEUES="priority_queue,secondary_queue" bundle exec rake qc:work
```
In this scenario, on each iteration of the worker's loop, it will look for jobs in the first queue prior to looking at the second queue. This means that the first queue must be empty before the worker will look at the second queue.

#### Custom Worker

This example is probably not production ready; however, it serves as an example of how to leverage the code in the Worker class to fit your non-default requirements.

```ruby
require 'timeout'
require 'queue_classic'

FailedQueue = QC::Queue.new("failed_jobs")

class MyWorker < QC::Worker
  def handle_failure(job, e)
    FailedQueue.enqueue(job[:method], *job[:args])
  end
end

worker = MyWorker.new

trap('INT') { exit }
trap('TERM') { worker.stop }

loop do
  job = worker.lock_job
  Timeout::timeout(5) { worker.process(job) }
end
```

The `qc:work` rake task uses `QC::Worker` by default. However, it's easy to
inject your own worker class:

```ruby
QC.default_worker_class = MyWorker
```

## Setup

In addition to installing the rubygem, you will need to prepare your database. Database preparation includes creating a table and loading PL/pgSQL functions. You can issue the database preparation commands using `PSQL(1)` or use a database migration script.

### Quick Start

```bash
$ gem install queue_classic
$ createdb queue_classic_test
$ export QC_DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@localhost/queue_classic_test"
$ ruby -r queue_classic -e "QC::Setup.create"
$ ruby -r queue_classic -e "QC.enqueue('Kernel.puts', 'hello world')"
$ ruby -r queue_classic -e "QC::Worker.new.work"
```

### Ruby on Rails Setup

Declare dependencies in Gemfile.
```ruby
source "http://rubygems.org"
gem "queue_classic", "~> 3.0.0"
```

Add the database tables and stored procedures.

```
rails generate queue_classic:install
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

#### Active Job

If you use Rails 4.2+, all you need to do is to set `config.active_job.queue_adapter = :queue_classic` in your `application.rb`. Everything else will be taken care for you. You can now use the Active Job functionality from now.

Just for your information, queue_classic detects your database connection and uses it.

### Rake Task Setup

Alternatively, you can use the Rake task to prepare your database.

```bash
# Creating the table and functions
$ bundle exec rake qc:create

# Dropping the table and functions
$ bundle exec rake qc:drop
```

### Database connection

#### Ruby on Rails

Starting with with queue_classic 3.1, Rails is automatically detected and its connection is used.

If you don't want to use the automatic database connection, set this environment variable to false: `export QC_RAILS_DATABASE=false`

**Note on using ActiveRecord migrations:** If you use the migration, and you wish to use commands that reset the database from the stored schema (e.g. `rake db:reset`), your application must be configured with `config.active_record.schema_format = :sql` in `config/application.rb`.  If you don't do this, the PL/pgSQL function that queue_classic creates will be lost when you reset the database.


#### Other Ruby apps

By default, queue_classic will use the QC_DATABASE_URL falling back on DATABASE_URL. The URL must be in the following format: `postgres://username:password@localhost/database_name`.  If you use Heroku's PostgreSQL service, this will already be set. If you don't want to set this variable, you can set the connection in an initializer. **QueueClassic will maintain its own connection to the database.** This may double the number of connections to your database.

## Upgrade from earlier versions
If you are upgrading from a previous version of queue_classic, you might need some new database columns and/or functions. Luckily enough for you, it is easy to do so.

### Ruby on Rails

You just need to run those lines, which will copy the new required migrations:

```
rails generate queue_classic:install
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```
### Rake Task

This rake task will get you covered:
```bash
# Updating the table and functions
$ bundle exec rake qc:update
```

## Configuration

All configuration takes place in the form of environment vars. See [queue_classic.rb](https://github.com/QueueClassic/queue_classic/blob/master/lib/queue_classic.rb#L23-62) for a list of options.

## JSON

If you are running PostgreSQL 9.4 or higher, queue_classic will use the [jsonb](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-json.html) datatype for new tables. Versions 9.2 and 9.3 will use the `json` data type and versions 9.1 and lower will use the `text` data type.
If you are updating queue_classic and are running PostgreSQL >= 9.4, run the following to switch to `jsonb`:
```
alter table queue_classic_jobs alter column args type jsonb using (args::jsonb);
```

## Logging

By default queue_classic does not talk very much.
If you find yourself in a situation where you need to know what's happening inside QC, there are two different kind of logging you can enable: DEBUG and MEASURE.

### Measure
This will output the time to process and that kind of thing. To enable it, set the `QC_MEASURE`:

```
export QC_MEASURE="true"
```

### Debug
You can enable the debug output by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```
export DEBUG="true"
```

1. List Versions: Ruby, PostgreSQL, queue_classic.
2. Define what you would have expected to happen.
3. List what actually happened.
4. Provide sample codes & commands which will reproduce the problem.
