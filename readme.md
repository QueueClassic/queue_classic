# queue_classic

v2.1.1

queue_classic provides a simple interface to a PostgreSQL-backed message queue. queue_classic specializes in concurrent locking and minimizing database load while providing a simple, intuitive developer experience. queue_classic assumes that you are already using PostgreSQL in your production environment and that adding another dependency (e.g. redis, beanstalkd, 0mq) is undesirable.

Features:

* Leverage of PostgreSQL's listen/notify & row locking.
* Support for multiple queues with heterogeneous workers.
* JSON data format.
* Forking workers.
* [Fuzzy-FIFO support](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~shanir/nir-pubs-web/Papers/Lock_Free.pdf)

## Usage

There are 2 ways to use queue_classic.

* Producing Jobs
* Working Jobs

### Producing Jobs

```ruby
# This method has no arguments.
QC.enqueue("Time.now")

# This method has 1 argument.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.puts", "hello world")

# This method has 2 arguments.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.printf", "hello %s", "world")

# This method has a hash argument.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.puts", {"hello" => "world"})

# This method has an array argument.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.puts", ["hello", "world"])

# This method uses a non-default queue.
p_queue = QC::Queue.new(q_name: "priority_queue")
p_queue.enqueue("Kernel.puts", ["hello", "world"])
```

QueueClassic uses [OkJson](https://github.com/kr/okjson) to encode the job's payload.

```ruby
# OK
OkJson.encode({"test" => "test"})

# NOT OK
OkJson.encode({:test => "test"})
```

### Working Jobs

There are two ways to work jobs. The first approach is to use the Rake task. The second approach is to use a custom executable.

#### Rake Task

Require queue_classic in your Rakefile.

```ruby
require 'queue_classic'
require 'queue_classic/tasks'
```

Start the worker via the Rakefile.

```bash
$ bundle exec rake qc:work
```

Setup a worker to work a non-default queue.

```bash
$ QUEUE="priority_queue" bundle exec rake qc:work
```

#### Custom Worker

This example is probably not production ready; however, it serves as an example of how to leverage the code in the Worker class to fit your non-default requirements.

```ruby
require 'timeout'
require 'queue_classic'

trap('INT') {exit}
trap('TERM') {worker.stop}

FailedQueue = QC::Queue.new("failed_jobs")

class MyWorker < QC::Worker
 	def handle_failure(job, e)
		FailedQueue.enqueue(job)
 	end
end

worker = MyWorker.new(max_attempts: 10, listening_worker: true)

loop do
	job = worker.lock_job
	Thread.new do
		begin
			Timeout::timeout(5) {worker.call(job)}
		rescue => e
			handle_failure(job, e)
		ensure
			worker.delete(job[:id])
		end
	end
end
```

## Setup

In addition to installing the rubygem, you will need to prepare your database. Database preparation includes creating a table and loading PL/pgSQL functions. You can issue the database preparation commands using `PSQL(1)` or use a database migration script.

### Quick Start

```bash
$ gem install queue_classic
$ createdb queue_classic_test
$ export QC_DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@localhost/queue_classic_test"
$ ruby -r queue_classic -e "QC::Setup.create"
$ ruby -r queue_classic -e "QC.enqueue('Kernel.puts', 'hello world')"
$ ruby -r queue_classic -e "QC::Worker.new.work"
```

### Ruby on Rails Setup

Declare dependencies in Gemfile.

```ruby
source :rubygems
gem "queue_classic", "2.1.1"
```

Require these files in your Rakefile so that you can run `rake qc:work`.

```ruby
require "queue_classic"
require "queue_classic/tasks"
```

By default, queue_classic will use the QC_DATABASE_URL falling back on DATABASE_URL. The URL must be in the following format: `postgres://username:password@localhost/database_name`.  If you use Heroku's PostgreSQL service, this will already be set. If you don't want to set this variable, you can set the connection in an initializer. **QueueClassic will maintain its own connection to the database.** This may double the number of connections to your database. Set QC::Conn.connection to share the connection between Rails & QueueClassic

```ruby
require 'queue_classic'
QC::Conn.connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.raw_connection
```

**Note on using ActiveRecord migrations:** If you use the migration, and you wish to use commands that reset the database from the stored schema (e.g. `rake db:reset`), your application must be configured with `config.active_record.schema_format = :sql` in `config/application.rb`.  If you don't do this, the PL/pgSQL function that queue_classic creates will be lost when you reset the database.

```ruby
require 'queue_classic'

class AddQueueClassic < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    QC::Setup.create
  end

  def self.down
    QC::Setup.drop
  end
end
```

### Rake Task Setup

Alternatively, you can use the Rake task to prepare your database.

```bash
# Creating the table and functions
$ bundle exec rake qc:create

# Dropping the table and functions
$ bundle exec rake qc:drop
```

## Configuration

All configuration takes place in the form of environment vars. See [queue_classic.rb](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/queue_classic/blob/master/lib/queue_classic.rb#L23-62) for a list of options.

## Hacking on queue_classic

### Dependencies

* Ruby 1.9.2 (tests work in 1.8.7 but compatibility is not guaranteed or supported)
* Postgres ~> 9.0
* Rubygem: pg ~> 0.11.0
* For JRuby, see [queue_classic_java](https://github.com/bdon/queue_classic_java)

### Running Tests

```bash
$ bundle
$ createdb queue_classic_test
$ export QC_DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:pass@localhost/queue_classic_test"
$ rake
```
