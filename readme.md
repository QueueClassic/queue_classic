# queue_classic

v2.2.0

queue_classic provides a simple interface to a PostgreSQL-backed message queue. queue_classic specializes in concurrent locking and minimizing database load while providing a simple, intuitive developer experience. queue_classic assumes that you are already using PostgreSQL in your production environment and that adding another dependency (e.g. redis, beanstalkd, 0mq) is undesirable.

Features:

* Leverage of PostgreSQL's listen/notify & row locking.
* Support for multiple queues with heterogeneous workers.
* JSON data format.
* Forking workers.
* [Fuzzy-FIFO support](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~shanir/nir-pubs-web/Papers/Lock_Free.pdf).

## Usage

There are 2 ways to use queue_classic.

* Producing Jobs
* Working Jobs

### Producing Jobs

The first argument is a string which represents a ruby object and a method name. The second argument(s) will be passed along as arguments to the method invocation defined by the first argument. The set of arguments will be encoded as JSON in the database.

```ruby
# This method has no arguments.
QC.enqueue("Time.now")

# This method has 1 argument.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.puts", "hello world")

# This method has 2 arguments.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.printf", "hello %s", "world")

# This method has a hash argument.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.puts", {"hello" => "world"})

# This method has an array argument.
QC.enqueue("Kernel.puts", ["hello", "world"])

# This method uses a non-default queue.
p_queue = QC::Queue.new("priority_queue")
p_queue.enqueue("Kernel.puts", ["hello", "world"])
```

### Working Jobs

There are two ways to work jobs. The first approach is to use the Rake task. The second approach is to use a custom executable.

#### Rake Task

Require queue_classic in your Rakefile.

```ruby
require 'queue_classic'
require 'queue_classic/tasks'
```

Start the worker via the Rakefile.

```bash
$ bundle exec rake qc:work
```

Setup a worker to work a non-default queue.

```bash
$ QUEUE="priority_queue" bundle exec rake qc:work
```

#### Custom Worker

This example is probably not production ready; however, it serves as an example of how to leverage the code in the Worker class to fit your non-default requirements.

```ruby
require 'timeout'
require 'queue_classic'

FailedQueue = QC::Queue.new("failed_jobs")

class MyWorker < QC::Worker
 	def handle_failure(job, e)
		FailedQueue.enqueue(job)
 	end
end

worker = MyWorker.new

trap('INT') {exit}
trap('TERM') {worker.stop}

loop do
	job = worker.lock_job
	Thread.new do
	  Timeout::timeout(5) { worker.process(job) }
	end
end
```

## Setup

In addition to installing the rubygem, you will need to prepare your database. Database preparation includes creating a table and loading PL/pgSQL functions. You can issue the database preparation commands using `PSQL(1)` or use a database migration script.

### Quick Start

```bash
$ gem install queue_classic
$ createdb queue_classic_test
$ export QC_DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@localhost/queue_classic_test"
$ ruby -r queue_classic -e "QC::Setup.create"
$ ruby -r queue_classic -e "QC.enqueue('Kernel.puts', 'hello world')"
$ ruby -r queue_classic -e "QC::Worker.new.work"
```

### Ruby on Rails Setup

Declare dependencies in Gemfile.

```ruby
source "http://rubygems.org"
gem "queue_classic", "2.2.0"
```

Require these files in your Rakefile so that you can run `rake qc:work`.

```ruby
require "queue_classic"
require "queue_classic/tasks"
```

By default, queue_classic will use the QC_DATABASE_URL falling back on DATABASE_URL. The URL must be in the following format: `postgres://username:password@localhost/database_name`.  If you use Heroku's PostgreSQL service, this will already be set. If you don't want to set this variable, you can set the connection in an initializer. **QueueClassic will maintain its own connection to the database.** This may double the number of connections to your database. Set QC::Conn.connection to share the connection between Rails & QueueClassic

```ruby
require 'queue_classic'
QC::Conn.connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.raw_connection
```

**Note on using ActiveRecord migrations:** If you use the migration, and you wish to use commands that reset the database from the stored schema (e.g. `rake db:reset`), your application must be configured with `config.active_record.schema_format = :sql` in `config/application.rb`.  If you don't do this, the PL/pgSQL function that queue_classic creates will be lost when you reset the database.

```ruby
require 'queue_classic'

class AddQueueClassic < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    QC::Setup.create
  end

  def self.down
    QC::Setup.drop
  end
end
```

### Rake Task Setup

Alternatively, you can use the Rake task to prepare your database.

```bash
# Creating the table and functions
$ bundle exec rake qc:create

# Dropping the table and functions
$ bundle exec rake qc:drop
```

## Configuration

All configuration takes place in the form of environment vars. See [queue_classic.rb](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/queue_classic/blob/master/lib/queue_classic.rb#L23-62) for a list of options.

## JSON

If you are running PostgreSQL 9.2 or higher, queue_classic will use the [json](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/datatype-json.html) datatype for storing arguments. Versions 9.1 and lower will use the 'text' column. If you have installed queue_classic prior to version 2.1.4 and are running PostgreSQL >= 9.2, run the following to switch to using the json type:
```
alter table queue_classic_jobs alter column args type json using (args::json);
```

## Logging

By default queue_classic does not talk very much.
If you find yourself in a situation where you need to know what's happening inside QC,
you can enable the debug output by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```
export DEBUG="true"
```

## Support

If you think you have found a bug, feel free to open an issue. Use the following template for the new issue:

1. List Versions: Ruby, PostgreSQL, queue_classic.
2. Define what you would have expcted to happen.
3. List what actually happened.
4. Provide sample codes & commands which will reproduce the problem.

If you have general questions about how to use queue_classic, send a message to the mailing list:
